# Mastering Extreme Programming

This project aims to master Extreme Programming through its real application in learning software development topics related to our journey to become reals software crafters.

# Why Extreme Programming?

I want to become a real software crafter, but, how do I avoid getting lost on the way? Since planning is not a skill that I have developed, there is a great risk of failing on the journey! How can I address this risk?

Extreme Programming aims to deliver excellent software through the application of **proven practices** that are guided for values and principles. Some of these practices are planning oriented. That's the key to addressing the risk mentioned above. I'll use thoses practices as guidance.

Also, other practices of Extreme Programming are a MUST for each software developer or person on the software crafter journey. But instead of making theoretical and boring content with unpractical coding examples, I wish to learn through making content that maps Extreme Programming practices with real software development use cases.

# Let started!

Extreme Programming is about changing and tackling our issues to do our best work every day. So, based on that premise and according to the Baby Steps principle of Extreme Programming, "What's the least you could do that is recognizably in the right direction?", I think that the beginning is creating a roadmap that allows me to have an overall plan of this project. Maybe I'm right, maybe not, but Failure as a learning source is another principle of Extreme Programming. I don't know how to do a roadmap, so I need to learn it and do it. Hands ons!
