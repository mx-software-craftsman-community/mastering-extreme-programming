# Single Code Base

Although Kent Beck classifies _Single Code Base_ as a corollary practice, my experience has learn me that this is one of the first practices that **MUST** be adopted for XP teams (or other agile or not agile teams!). The _Single Code Base_ practice will save you a lot of wasted time and headaches caused by an untrusted code base that will slow down software development and make it prone to errors (even serious ones). Moreover, there are concrete and proven ways to implement this practice, so there are no excuses.  

I think that below are the most important statements that Kent Beck put down in _XP Explained_ about the _Single Code Base_ practice:

> "_There is only one code stream. You can develop in a temporary branch, but never let it live longer than a few hours._"  
>
> "_Multiple code streams are an enormous source of waste in software development._"  
>
> "_Rather than add more code bases, fix the underlying design problem that is preventing you from running from a single code base._"
